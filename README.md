# Xojo-WebFileBrowser

This is a Xojo Web File Browser with API 2.0. I've tried to learn something new and got something to share.

1. For Windows at this moment. (you can change the **SpecialFolder.___** to match your OSes)
2. Implement 
  - show FolderItem info
  - go to parent folder
  - double click to go into a folder 
  - has Session.CurrentFolder
  - if it's **.jpg** or **.png**, it'll show the image at the WebImageViewer
  - IOException
  
## TODO
1. File/Image Uploader
